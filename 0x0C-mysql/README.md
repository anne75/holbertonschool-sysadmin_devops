## Install master and slave MySQL servers

([image](http://i.imgur.com/KkrkDHT.png))  

For this project, given 2 servers we had to create a master and slave MySQL database.  
We were given these tutorials [1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-choose-a-redundancy-plan-to-ensure-high-availability#sql-replication) and [2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-master-slave-replication-in-mysql), but starting from scratch (no data), the documentation gives a better way.
