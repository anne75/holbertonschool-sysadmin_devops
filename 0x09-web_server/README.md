## Web Server
([image](http://i.imgur.com/8Gu52Qv.png))  
Building on the ssh project, here we use `scp` to copy files to our server, install nginx on it and fiddle with its configuration file to create a `301` and custom `404` HTTP responses.  
Other command used is `curl` to GET the HTTP requests from the server.  
All scripts written try to automate each task.
